# Competition Summary

## Description

There are as many as 300 different languages (approximately 50 of these from Africa) with new signs evolving each day as a need appears.

Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) is used in Kenya and Somalia, and there are different dialects depending on what region you are in.

It is used by over half of Kenya's estimated 600 000-strong deaf population.

The objective of this competition is to build a model to recognise ten different everyday KSL signs present in the images, using machine learning or deep learning algorithms.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The dataset was collected specifically for a Zindi competition. 

The data was collected by 800 taskers from Kenya, Mexico and India.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge is Log Loss.

## Prizes

1st Place: $2 500 USD

2nd Place: $1 500 USD

3rd Place: $1 000 USD


## Benefits

The solutions will help address the common misconception of sign language is that it is the same everywhere; in reality there are as many as 300 different languages (approximately 50 of these from Africa) with new signs evolving each day as a need appears.

The Solutions helps to classify the ten different Kenyan Sign Language signs.
