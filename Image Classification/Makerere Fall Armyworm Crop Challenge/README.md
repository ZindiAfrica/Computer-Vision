# Competition Summary

## Description

Fall armyworm is a devastating pest in Africa, where it has no natural predators - African farmers say the pest causes average maize losses of 31% annually. Maize is the most widely grown crop in Africa and a staple for around half the continentâ€™s people - over 300 million Africans depend on the crop for food and nutritional security. For smallholder farmers in particular, maize is popular for its wide adaptability, valuable by-products and high yields.

Because of this reliance on staple crops for food security, Viral pests and diseases like fall armyworm are one of the leading causes of food insecurity and poverty in Africa. Thus there is an urgent need to design early intervention mechanisms to help prevent crop losses for smallholder farmers.

In this challenge, your objective is to classify if a plant has been affected by a fall armyworm. This is a binary image classification challenge. The solution will be deployed as part of a mobile-based edge application which can be used by smallholder farmers in Uganda and the rest of Africa to carry out field-based diagnosis and intervene before fall armyworm devastates their maize crop for the season.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The dataset was collected specifically for a Zindi competition. 

The images were collected from the Eastern, Western and Central regions of Uganda.

The dataset contains about 4000 images resized to 512x512.

There are ~5000 fruit in total. Some images contain more than one fruit and thus more than one bounding box. 


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this competition is Area Under the Curve (AUC).
