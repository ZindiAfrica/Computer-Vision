# Competition Summary

## Description

All enzymes are made of one or more chains of amino acids, which determine their structure, behaviour, and interactions with other enzymes and molecules.

That means it should be possible to predict the proteinâ€™s function and behaviour given just the amino acid sequence.

The objective is to create a model that can label sequences from new organisms.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The data for this competition consists of labelled amino acid sequences. 

Each sequence has a unique ID, the amino acid sequence, the organism it came from and the label.

In addition to the labelled data, a large set of unlabelled sequences were also provided.

External data was not allowed for this competition.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge is Accuracy.

## Prizes

The top 10 submissions will earn up to 2000 Zindi Points.

The top three data scientists will be eligible for an interview for the opportunity to join Instadeep.

## Benefits

The solutions would have many applications. The soluions will be able to quickly annotate vast numbers of metagenomic sequences.

Solutions developed in the course of this challenge may contribute to furthering the understanding of the world around us.
