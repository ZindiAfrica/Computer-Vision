# Competition Summary

## Description

Particles are the tiny constituents of matter generated in a collision between proton bunches. Physicists at CERN study particles using particle accelerators. 

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the worldâ€™s largest and most powerful particle accelerator and is used to accelerate and collide protons as well as heavy lead ions.

The LHC consists of a 27-kilometre ring of superconducting magnets with a number of accelerating structures to boost the energy of the particles along the way.

Particle Identification (PID) is fundamental to particle physics experiments. Currently no machine learning solution exists for PID.

The goal of this challenge is to build a machine learning model to read images of particles and identify their type.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The training dataset comprises of 350 independent simulated events (collisions).

Where each event contains approximately 3,000 labeled images of different particle trajectories passing through many detectors resulting from the collision.

The training data consists of 350 .pkl files, each representing a unique event (or collision).


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge is Log Loss.

## Prizes

The top 10 submissions will earn up to 2000 Zindi Points.


## Benefits

This challenge is part of an effort to explore the use of machine learning to assist high energy physicists in discovering and characterizing new particles.
