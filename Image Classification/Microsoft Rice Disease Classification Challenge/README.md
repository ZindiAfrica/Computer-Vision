# Competition Summary

## Description

Rice is a staple crop in Egypt, but despite Egyptâ€™s position as the top rice producer in Africa, it still relies on imports to meet the demands of its population. One of the main causes of this gap in Egypt is rice blast disease, which is responsible for 30% loss in rice production worldwide.

Early detection is the best way to manage crop diseases like rice blast, but rice blast is easily misclassified as brown spot disease - both are fungal diseases and have similar appearances in their early stage. With the current scarcity of experienced agricultural extension officers in the country, there is a clear case for recent technological advances in computer vision to help in early diagnosis, particularly by using multispectral images of crops.

The objective of this challenge is to predict the disease of a rice plant in RGB and Infrared images. Top solutions will receive money prizes and will be included in a joint publication with the organisers.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The dataset was collected specifically for a Zindi competition. 

The images were collected from the Eastern, Western and Central regions of Uganda.

The dataset contains about 4000 images resized to 512x512.

There are ~5000 fruit in total. Some images contain more than one fruit and thus more than one bounding box. 


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge is the Log Loss.
