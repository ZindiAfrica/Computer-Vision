# Rice disease : 5th place solution
## Solution summary
The solution consists of an ensemble of 9 models trained on the rgb data.
1. data preprocessing
* We deleted redundant images  in the rgb data.
   
*  create 5 stratified folds on  the Label column.
2. trained models
   

   
   
The proposed solution consists of an ensemble of 9 different models as described bellow:

1. Ensemble 


* ensemble with hill climbing  on the probabilities predictions

## Steps
1. Place competition data in `input/` directory
2. Run `notebooks\preprocess.ipynb` to create `input/train_rgb_purged.csv` containing purged data.
3. Run `./run.sh` to train all the models
4. Run the `notebooks\ensemble.ipynb`  to get the final submission file  
The output file is `ensemble_last.csv`

## Hardware/OS used for the competition
- CPU: AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 9 3900X, 24cores
- GPU: RTX 3080TI
- RAM: 32GB
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04
