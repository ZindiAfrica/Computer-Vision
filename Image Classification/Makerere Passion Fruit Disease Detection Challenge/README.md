# Competition Summary

## Description

Passion fruit pests and diseases in Uganda lead to reduced yields and decreased investment in farming over time. 

Most Ugandan farmers (including passion fruit farmers) are smallholder farmers from low-income households, and do not have sufficient information and means to combat these challenges. 

The Marconi Society Machine Learning Laboratory at Makerere University is addressing the lack of a reliable, timely diagnostic platform for passion fruit diseases by developing a low-cost hand-held diagnostic device (based on the Raspberry Pi) making use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

The objective of this challenge is to classify the disease status of a plant given an image of a passion fruit.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The dataset was collected specifically for a Zindi competition. 

The images were collected from the Eastern, Western and Central regions of Uganda.

The dataset contains about 4000 images resized to 512x512.

There are ~5000 fruit in total. Some images contain more than one fruit and thus more than one bounding box. 


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The error metric for this competition is Mean Average Precision @ Intersection over Union(IoU) threshold -0.5.


## Prizes

1st Place: $500 USD

2nd Place: $300 USD

3rd Place: $200 USD

The points awarded for this competition was 3000 Zindi points.


## Benefits

The solutions will be deployed as part of a device to aid smallholder farmers in making a prompt diagnosis in their passion fruit crops.
