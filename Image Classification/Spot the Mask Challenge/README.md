# Competition Summary

## Description

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently advised the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.

Wearing masks is broadly recognised as critical to reducing community transmission and limiting touching of the face.

In a time of concern about slowing the transmission of COVID-19, increased surveillance combined with AI solutions can improve monitoring and reduce the human effort needed to limit the spread of this disease.

The objective of this challenge is to create an image classification machine learning model to accurately predict the likelihood that an image contains a person wearing a face mask, or not.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The data sets provided were only used. External data was not allowed.

The total dataset contains 1,800+ images of people either wearing masks or not.

The training set contains ~1300 images and the test set contains 509 images.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge is Log Loss.

## Prizes

This is a learning competition.


## Benefits

The solutions will help policymakers, law enforcement, hospitals, and even commercial businesses ensure that masks are being worn appropriately in public.

These solutions can help in the battle to reduce community transmission of COVID-19.
