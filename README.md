# Computer-Vision Overview


“If we want machines to think, we need to teach them to see.” - Fei Fei Li, Director of Stanford AI Lab and Stanford Vision Lab

## Definition	

Computer Vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from  digital images, videos and other visual input.
	
		
## History

Starting from the 1960s to late 1970s, the goal of image analysis was to attach a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw.
Studies in the 1970s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, non-polyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.
Recently, the advancement of Deep Learning learning techniques has further improved the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on different data sets for tasks on classification, segmentation has surpassed prior methods.


## Task
		
Image Classification:  It is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels or vectors within an image based on specific rules.
	
Object Detection: It is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos.	
		
## Applications

Computer Vision can be used in many fields- Medicine, Military, Agriculture, HealthCareand many more.
	
Zindi has hosted some challenges based on Computer vision.
