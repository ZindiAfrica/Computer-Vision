# Competition Summary

## Description

Since 1998, Local Ocean Conservation (LOC) has been running a by catch net release program.

By catch is when a non-target species, in this case endangered and critically endangered species of marine turtles, are captured in fishing gear accidently.

Local Ocean Conservation works with around 350 local fishermen who, instead of slaughtering the turtles they catch or leaving them to die, contact LOC.

The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to help Kenyan non-profit organization Local Ocean Conservation identify potential errors and anomalies in their sea turtle rescue database from their By-Catch Release Programme.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The data used to train the model will be ‘dirty’ and ‘cleaned’ data containing all of the unique sea turtle rescues that took place from 1998 until 2011.

To date, Local Ocean Conservation has released over 10,000 sea turtles.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The Mean Absolute Error will be used to evaluate the accuracy of your predictions.

## Prizes

1st Place: $400 USD + a 1 week holiday package at Temple Point Resort* (a value of $1 100 USD) = Total Value of $1 500 USD

2nd Place: $300 USD

3rd Place: $150 USD

* Temple Point Resort is a premier holiday beach resort located at the end of a headland between the Indian Ocean and Mida Creek. Surrounded by tropical gardens and the Mida Creek lagoon, the hotel is situated right inside the Watamu Marine National Park. The 1st place winner will receive a double room full-board 7-day stay at Temple Point Resort.



## Benefits

At the end of the year, LOC staff review each rescue/field to compare the database entry with the hand-written log book to ensure the integrity of the data.

The Solutions will help LOC reduce the amount of time and effort needed for the review process.
