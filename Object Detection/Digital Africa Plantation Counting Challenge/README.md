# Competition Summary

## Description

Palm oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp (reddish pulp) of the fruit of the oil palms. The oil is used in food manufacturing, beauty products, and as biofuel.

The objective of this challenge is to create a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm to count the number of palm oil trees in an image.

## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).

## Datasets and packages

This data was collected using drones over 4 farms in CÃ´te d'Ivoire in July and September 2022.

There are 2002 images in train. There are 858 images in test.

Some images might contain 0 palm oil trees as it is the edge of a field.

## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.

## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:

- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)

## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.

## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge is Root Mean Squared Error.

## Prizes

- 1st man - $4 000 USD either as an individual first man or majority male team.

- 1st woman - $4 000 USD either as an individual first woman or majority female team.

- 1st person from Ivory Coast - $2 000 USD, different from top man or woman prize.

## Benefits

This will aid farmers to determine the number of trees on their plot and estimated crop yield. The semi supervised nature of this solution will allow this solution to be applied to other plantations such as banana palms.
